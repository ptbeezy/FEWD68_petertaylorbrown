	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<div class="text-container">
		<p>I connect behavioral science, design, and technology to create impactful products, meaningful experiences, and lasting brand relationships. My past work has been in producing both B2B and consumer facing creative solutions for companies that include Spotify, Michael Kors, Nickelodeon, LDV Hospitality, Rite Aid, and Calvin Klein. I currently work at McKinsey Digital Labs as part of a company-wide digital transformation initiative for McKinsey &amp; Company.
			<br><br>
		I work closely with the project owners from any stage of the process to help define strategies, create collateral, and ensure that seamless user-centered solutions are developed that will establish value for both the brand and the target audience. Wherever possible, I will help your team identify metrics that will measure performance, help optimize interactions, and allow for data-driven improvements to increase the long-term viability of any solution. 
			<br><br>
		I love collaborating with inspiring people on challenging projects, learning with others while doing, and sharing my knowledge to aid in the professional growth of team members - please feel free to reach out for potential projects and consultation requests. If I can't take on the project myself, I will refer you to very talented people who can!
