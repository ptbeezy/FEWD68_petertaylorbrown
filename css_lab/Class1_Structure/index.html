		<h3>And now for THE RAINBOW CONNECTION!</h3>
		<p>Why are there so many songs about rainbows<br>
			And what's on the other side<br>
			Rainbows are visions<br>
			But only illusions<br>
			And rainbows have nothing to hide<br>
			<br>
			So we've been told<br>
			And some choose to believe it<br>
			I know they're wrong, wait and see<br>
			Some day we'll find it<br>
			The rainbow connection<br>
			The lovers, the dreamers, and me<br>
			<br>
			Who said that every wish<br>
			Would be heard and answered<br>
			When wished on the morning star<br>
			Somebody thought of that<br>
			And someone believed it<br>
			And look what it's done so far<br>
			<br>
			What's so amazing<br>
			That keeps us stargazing<br>
			And what do we think we might see<br>
			Someday we'll find it<br>
			The rainbow connection<br>
			The lovers, the dreamers, and me<br>
			<br>
			All of us under its spell, we know that it's probably magic<br>
			<br>
			Have you been half asleep?<br>
			And have you heard voices?<br>
			I've heard them calling my name<br>
			Is this the sweet sound<br>
			That called the young sailors?<br>
			The voice might be one in the same<br>
			<br>
			I've heard it too many times to ignore it<br>
			It's something that I'm supposed to be<br>
			Someday we'll find it<br>
			The rainbow connection<br>
			The lovers, the dreamers and me<br>
			<br>
			La da da di da da dum da duh da da dum di da ohhh<br>
